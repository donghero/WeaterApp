## Weather App
weather report by Expo 

# First, my weather app is based on expo. It is more convenient than react-native

# Second, the major code files are three. {App.js} {Loading.js} {Weather.js}

I use "expo-location"API and get current position and show correct weather tempearature. 

I have already learned react.js and it's the first time to make a app by expo. My weather app is not 

very big, but it has a big impact on me.

# Third, have a nice day!
